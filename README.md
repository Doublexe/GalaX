To extend the idea of github to real society. To promote new ideas.

this project is amied at promoting real world ideas and use a system like github to manage them.
the system should be friendly to normal users, i.e. it should be generally graphical. the system itself will be here at github so that its function can be consistently advance. the system should be also including feature of quora (vote), a map (denoting geometrical information) and slack (that different functions can be added isolately).

hope to meet someone interested in it!
