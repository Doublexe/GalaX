To promote, in general, feelings.

This project aims to solve a problem that people are actually trapped in their own rountines these days. But the world has a whole lot more to explore, including real things as well as feelings. Essentially, they are different feelings.

Problem to solve: the isolation deep inside our hearts.

Solution: A pseudo-map. A map that represents the world of feelings, based on real world map.

Hope to meet someone interested in it!
